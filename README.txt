Step 4: Adding a new model and view to the file
Followed all the steps from the tutorial and changed according to the app we are making.

Making a cs file file for database and adding all the columns
Followed by installing the packages and scaffolding the data


There were some errors in it but I manage to change it since it was just spelling errors.
